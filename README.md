# Project Management Dashboard

A production-style **Project Management Dashboard** built to demonstrate scalable front-end architecture, modern state management, and API-driven workflows commonly used in professional software teams.

This project focuses on real-world application patterns — handling global state, async data, and complex UI behavior — rather than isolated UI components.

> 🚧 **Status:** Coming Soon / In Active Development

---

## Overview

This dashboard simulates a real-world issue tracking system similar to tools like Jira or Linear. Users can view, manage, and organize project issues through a clean, responsive interface.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase:
- Scalable React application architecture
- Predictable global state management
- API-based data flows
- Professional UI and UX patterns

---

## Key Features (Planned)

- View and manage project issues in a dashboard layout  
- Create, edit, and delete issues with form validation  
- Filter issues by status and priority  
- Sort and paginate large issue lists  
- Global state management using Redux Toolkit  
- Async data fetching with loading and error states  
- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout  

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React (Functional Components & Hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

**State Management**
- Redux Toolkit
- RTK Query (API data fetching and caching)

**Data & APIs**
- REST APIs
- Async request handling with loading and error states

**Styling**
- CSS (responsive, dashboard-style layouts)

## Why This Project?

This project was designed to go beyond basic CRUD applications and demonstrate skills commonly required in junior-to-mid front-end roles, including:

- Managing complex shared application state
- Structuring React apps for scalability and maintainability
- Working with real API data instead of static mock data
- Building interfaces that resemble production software

---

## Planned Enhancements

- Authentication and protected routes
- User assignment for issues
- Advanced filtering and search
- Optimistic UI updates
- Improved accessibility and keyboard navigation

---

## Career Context

This project is part of my portfolio as a **Junior Front-End / React Developer** and reflects my focus on building production-minded applications using modern tools and best practices.

## Status

🚧 **Coming Soon**  
This project is actively being developed and will be updated with live demos and source code as features are completed.
